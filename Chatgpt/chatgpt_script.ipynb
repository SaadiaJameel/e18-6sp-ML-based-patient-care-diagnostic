It's best to try to identify the cause of the headache and address it accordingly. If the headache persists or becomes severe, it's important to seek medical attention. In the meantime, you can try some remedies such as drinking plenty of water, taking a break from screens, applying a cold compress, and resting in a quiet, dark environment. \n",
