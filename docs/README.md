## Introduction

In an era where technology is being tested to its limits in terms of making ones life easy, we see a need for this approach in the medical industry as well. 

If you realy think about it, there is little to nothing we know about our own bodies and how our body reacts to certain things. In fact when we fall ill most of us seem to be helpless unless met with a professional and advice is given to us. This demonstrates the huge gap between the knowledge of a doctor and that of a patient. 

The motivation behind our project is to bridge this gap of knowledge between a doctor and patients. 

## Solution Architecture

The microcontroller and its peripherals (sensors) will sense the speed, the type of line crossed by the vehicle and the distance from the vehicle to an incoming vehicle on the other lane. 

These information will be then sent to the database only when a line is crossed on the road. In the backend we will perform computations to determine the severity of the crossing of a road line and the road rule breakage.

Finally, in our application, necessary details will be displayed for all drivers in the form of a plot. Motor traffic related authorities will then be able to asses the drivers automatically.
